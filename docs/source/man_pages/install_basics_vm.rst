Installing Basic Tools
======================

You will need to download some basic tools before you even begin to try and start planning your bioinformatics workflow.

.. note::

    If you have suggestions on what tools and software to add, please open an issue at `https://github.com/BarryDigby/Cloud_CIX/issues <https://github.com/BarryDigby/Cloud_CIX/issues>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get update; 
    sudo apt-get clean all;
    sudo apt-get --yes install \
